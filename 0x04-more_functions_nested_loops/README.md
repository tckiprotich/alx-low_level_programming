# Project Name.
**0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops**

## Author's Details.
Name: *Wendy Munyasi.*

Tel:*+254707240068.*

##  Requirements
*   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
*   All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` .
*   Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` .
*   All your files should end with a new line.
*   You are not allowed to use global variables.
*   No more than 5 functions per file.
*   You are not allowed to use the standard library unless stated otherwise. Any use of functions like  `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden.
*   You are allowed to use `_putchar`.
*   The `main.c` files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
*   The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`.

## Project Description.
Practising more on funtions and nested loops.

* **0. isupper** - Write a function that checks for uppercase character. - `0-isupper.c`.
* **1. isdigit** - Write a function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`). - `1-isdigit.c`.
* **2. Collaboration is multiplication** - Write a function that multiplies two integers. - `2-mul.c`.
* **3. The numbers speak for themselves** - Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9`, followed by a new line. - `3-print_numbers.c`.
* **4. I believe in numbers and signs** - Write a function that prints the numbers, from `0` to `9` apart from `2` and `4`, followed by a new line. - `4-print_most_numbers.c`.
* **5. Numbers constitute the only universal language** - Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line. - `5-more_numbers.c`.
* **6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line** - Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal. - `6-print_line.c`.
* **7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe** - Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal. - `7-print_diagonal.c`.
* **8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch** - Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line. - `8-print_square.c`.
* **9. Fizz-Buzz** - Write a program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`. - `9-fizz_buzz.c`.
* **10. Triangles** - Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line. - `10-print_triangle.c`.
* **11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic** - Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number `612852475143`, followed by a new line. - `100-prime_factor.c`.
* **12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper** - Write a function that prints an integer. - `101-print_number.c`.
